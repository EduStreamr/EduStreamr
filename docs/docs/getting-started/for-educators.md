### Setting Up Your Account
EduStreamr uses Thirdweb's in-app wallet feature, so you don't need an external wallet like MetaMask to use the platform. However, you can still use an external wallet if you prefer. Here's how you can set it up without an external wallet:

1. Visit [EduStreamr](https://edustreamr.xyz) and click on "Launch App"
2.Click the "Connect" button at the top right, then select "Continue with Google" or enter your email address
3. Complete the authentication process
4. Your in-app wallet will be automatically created

### Integrating with OBS
Integrating with OBS is a simple process that allows you to display tips on-screen in real time. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Visit [Alert Page](https://edustreamr.xyz/alert) and copy your alert URL
2. Create a new OBS Browser Source and paste the URL into the URL field
3. Send a test tip to ensure the alert is working correctly

### Receiving Tips
To receive tips, you need to share your tip URL with your audience during your streams. Here's how you can do this:

1. Visit [Dashboard Page](https://edustreamr.xyz/dashboard) and copy your tip URL
2. Share this URL with your audience during your streams
3. When viewers send tips, they'll appear on-screen in real time
4. You can respond to questions or acknowledge tips during your stream

### (Optional) Registering a username

Registering a username will allow you to use a shorter URL for your tip and alert URLs. This action requires a small transaction fee, so it's recommended to do this after receiving your first tip.

1. Visit [Settings Page](https://edustreamr.xyz/settings)
2. Enter your desired username and click "Register"
3. Your username will be registered and your tip and alert URLs will be updated accordingly

### Withdrawing Your Earnings

These steps only apply if you have registered a username. For non-username users, tips are directly transferred to your wallet.

1. Visit [Dashboard Page](https://edustreamr.xyz/dashboard)
2. View your pending tips
3. Click the "Withdraw" button
4. Your earnings will be transferred to your connected wallet
