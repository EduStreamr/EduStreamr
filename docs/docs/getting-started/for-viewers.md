### Creating a Wallet

EduStreamr uses Thirdweb's in-app wallet feature, so you don't need an external wallet like MetaMask to use the platform. However, you can still use an external wallet if you prefer. Here's how you can set it up without an external wallet:

1. Navigate to your favorite educator's tip page (usually shared by the educator during streams)
2. Click the "Connect" button at the top right, then select "Continue with Google" or enter your email address
3. Complete the authentication process
4. Your in-app wallet will be automatically created

### Funding Your Wallet
To send tips to educators, you'll need to fund your wallet. Here's how you can do it:
1. After [creating a wallet](/getting-started/for-viewers#creating-a-wallet), click the top right button to open your wallet
2. Click the copy icon to copy your wallet address
3. Visit a cryptocurrency exchange and transfer funds to your copied wallet address. You can find a list of popular exchanges [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/open-campus). Make sure that the exchange supports the **EDU Chain network**

### Sending Tips to Educators

1. Navigate to your favorite educator's tip page
2. Enter your name. If you don't prefer to share your name, you can enable "Anonymous" option

4. Enter your message
5. Click "Send Tip"
6. Once processed, your tip and message will be visible to the educator
